*******************
Server Requirements
*******************

PHP version 7.1 or newer is recommended.
Codeigniter version 3.1.9.

It should work on 5.6 as well, but we strongly advise you NOT to run
such old versions of PHP, because of potential security and performance
issues, as well as missing features.
